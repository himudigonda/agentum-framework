"""
Professional Research Pipeline - A Real-World Agentum Example

This example demonstrates agentum's professional capabilities by building
a complete research workflow that:
1. Uses real web search (Tavily API) to gather information
2. Synthesizes findings into a structured report
3. Saves the report to the filesystem

This showcases the transition from "mock tools" to "mission-ready" tools
that developers can use immediately in production.

Key Learning Points:
- How to structure a multi-agent workflow
- Real tool integration (web search + filesystem)
- State management across multiple tasks
- Event-driven observability
- Error handling and validation

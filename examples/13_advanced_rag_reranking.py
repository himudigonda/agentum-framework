Advanced RAG with Reranking Example

This example demonstrates Agentum's enhanced RAG capabilities with cross-encoder reranking.
The KnowledgeBase now includes automatic reranking to improve retrieval quality by
re-scoring documents based on query-document relevance using a cross-encoder model.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Advanced RAG with reranking
- Multi-document knowledge base
- Intelligent document retrieval
- Cross-encoder reranking for better relevance

"""
Flagship Example: Dynamic Multi-Agent Planning (The Planner Agent Pattern)

This example showcases the most advanced form of agency in Agentum: a Planner Agent.

1.  **Planner Agent (The Brain):** Receives a complex goal and outputs the name of the NEXT best task to run.
2.  **Worker Agents (The Hands):** Execute the specific task (e.g., Research, Summarize).
3.  **Conditional Edge (The Conductor):** Uses the Planner's text output to dynamically route the workflow.

This demonstrates true autonomous task decomposition.

To run this, ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set in your .env file.
